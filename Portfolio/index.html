            <p>Javascript is a language that I hold dear to my heart, it always challenges me! Every program is a new and different puzzle that I have to solve, I find that really exciting, while not creating the most beautiful projects on its own when combined with HTML and CSS anything becomes possible. It adds a level of individuality to each project that can not be matched.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="grow col-xl-4 col-lg-4 col-md-6 col-sm-6 mt-0 text-light"><i class="fab fa-html5 fa-pull-left mt-1"></i> <h3>HTML5</h3>
            <p>HTML is ground zero when it comes to web design, without this, the page would lack complete structure. HTML when used correctly allows anyone to create any site just how they want, the structure it provides allows Javascript and CSS (among many many others) to come in and shape the page into exactly what you want it to look like.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="grow col-xl-4 col-lg-4 col-md-6 col-sm-6 mt-0 bg-light"><i class="fab fa-css3-alt fa-pull-left mt-1"></i> <h3>CSS</h3>
            <p> CSS is what is primarily used to style the page and really allows for complete creative freedom, its a bit like painting, except really precise and you can make corrections. I really like this aspect since it allows me to explore any direction I could want, you can create absolutely anything you want, the possibilties are endless.
            </p>

          <div class="grow col-xl-4 col-lg-4 col-md-6 col-sm-6 mt-0 text-light"><i class="fab fa-cuttlefish fa-pull-left mt-1"></i> <h3>C Sharp</h3>
            <p> C Sharp was the first language I ever coded, and at the time I found it very challenging, but after two years of experience I got really comfortable using it. It gave me a good base to learn new languages and really gave me a great footing to move forward. I really like the idea of being able to create programs from the ground up and the challenge always really excites me.

            <p> I don't just enjoy programming! A big hobby of mine is editing videos, I have been making videos ever since I can remember from skateboard videos, to full blown productions with friends and for drama schools. Recently I have been filming the world champion wakeboarder on a new project for the 2019 season! My own wakeboard video which I edited was featured on one of the biggest online wakeboard magazines.

            <p> Photoshop is another Adobe product I enjoy using! While at first I used it to make funny photos of friends, I quickly understood all the tools and started creating as a hobby, manipulating photos and creating them from scratch became another on of my many hobbies. Some of the photos I have taken have been printed and featured in wakeboard magazines sold worldwide.

              <p>In this project I again used Javascript but this time I explored the use API's and data manipulation, the same libraries were used alongside the use of an API that tracks real time net worth of the top 400 richest people. I took this data and diplayed it to show the huge wage inequality in the world.</p>
